# SciNet
SciNet is currently in concept stage, where we are identifying key features and core design. You'll find most activity within the Architecture Info directory and Github issues.

SciNet is intended to be a supplement and alternative to scientific journals. Find key features below.

## Key Features
* Easy publishing
* Easy plain-text and tag-based searching
* Reviewer acknowledgement and recording
* Recognition and tracking of replication studies
* Dependency tracking via article citations

## Supporting Features
* Article hosting
* References to scientific journal publications
* APIs for third-party analysis
* Open Source

We hope to create an Open Source product backed by a non-profit entity. Any support with regards to design or code contributions are contributed. We are not seeking financial support until we have a working MVP and a non-profit entity for funds.

# Infrastructure Design
See Architecture Info/architecture.archimate. We use [Archi](http://www.archimatetool.com/).

# Database Design
See Architecture Info/database_design.xml. We use [WWW SQL Designer](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/?keyword=default).

# Building
There is currently nothing to build.

# Contributing
Nothing special yet. We have no contribution guidelines as we are still in planning stages. If you would like to help with planning, please hop over to the issues for this project.
